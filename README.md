## Module
**PUSL2022 – Introduction to IoT**

## Project Overview
This repository contains the coursework and practical components for the *Introduction to IoT* module.

The project focuses on designing an **end-to-end IoT-based Smart Building Automation & Energy Management system**, aimed at optimizing energy consumption and automating building environments using real-time data and smart control mechanisms.

> ⚠️ *This repository currently serves as a project skeleton. System components and technologies will be finalized during development.*
